# RetDec Radare2 plugin

![retdec-r2plugin CI](https://github.com/avast/retdec-r2plugin/workflows/retdec-r2plugin%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

RetDec plugin for [Radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2).

The plugin integrates RetDec decompiler into Radare2 console. RetDec Radare2 plugin is shipped with a bundled RetDec version, but you can use your own version (specified below).

With the bundled version of RetDec you can decompile the following architectures:
* 32-bit: Intel x86, ARM, MIPS, PIC32, and PowerPC.
* 64-bit: x86-64, ARM64 (AArch64).

## Installation and Use

The plugin was tested and should work on following operating systems: Linux, macOS and Windows.

### R2PM Installation

The r2pm package is available for Radare2 version 4.5.0 and newer. To install the plugin using r2pm use:

```bash
$ r2pm -i r2retdec
```

This will, however, install only the plugin for r2 console. To use the Iaito plugin you must build this plugin manually. See the [Build and Installation](https://github.com/avast/retdec-r2plugin#build-and-installation) section.

### Use in Radare2 Console

In r2 console you can type `pdz?` to print help:

```bash
Usage: pdz   # Native RetDec decompiler plugin.
| pdz      # Show decompilation result of current function.
| pdz*     # Show current decompiled function side by side with offsets.
| pdza[?]  # Run RetDec analysis.
| pdze     # Show environment variables.
| pdzj     # Dump current decompiled function as JSON.
| pdzo     # Show current decompiled function side by side with offsets.
```

The following environment variables may be used to dynamically customize the plugin's behavior:

```bash
$ export DEC_SAVE_DIR=<path> # custom path for output of decompilation to be saved to.
```

## Build and Installation

This section describes a local build and installation of RetDec Radare2 plugin.

### Requirements

* A compiler supporting c++17
* CMake (version >= 3.6)
* Existing Radare2 installation (version >= 4.5.0)

To build the bundled version of RetDec see [RetDec requirements section](https://github.com/avast/retdec#requirements).

### Process

* Clone the repository:
  * `git clone https://github.com/avast/retdec-r2plugin`
* Linux and MacOS:
  * `cd retdec-r2plugin`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`
  * `make -jN` (`N` is the number of processes to use for parallel build, typically number of cores + 1 gives fastest compilation time)
  * `make install`
* Windows:
  * Open a command prompt (e.g. `cmd.exe`)
  * `cd retdec-r2plugin`
  * `mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>`
  * `cmake --build . --config Release -- -m`
  * `cmake --build . --config Release --target install`

You have to pass the following parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path>` to set the installation path to `<path>`. It is important to set the `<path>` to a location where Radare2 can load plugins from (for example `~/.local`).

You can pass the following additional parameters to `cmake`:
* `-DBUILD_BUNDLED_RETDEC=ON` to build bundled RetDec version with the plugin. The build of the bundled RetDec is by default turned on. RetDec will be installed to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. When turned OFF system is searched for RetDec installation.
* `-DR2PLUGIN_DOC=OFF` optional parameter to build Doxygen documentation.
* `-DBUILD_IAITO_PLUGIN=OFF` setting to ON will build the Iaito plugin.

*Note*: retdec-r2plugin requires [filesystem](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem) library to be linked with the plugin. CMake will try to find the library in the system but on GCC 7 it might not be able to do so automatically. In that case you must specify a path where this library is located in the system to the cmake by adding:
* `-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=${PATH_TO_FILESTSTEM_DIR}`

On GCC 7 is `stdc++fs` located in:
* `-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/`
